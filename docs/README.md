# adfree DNS

We run a public privacy-protecting DNS server with advertising, tracker, and malware filtering. The Usable Privacy DNS \(updns\) service is accessible via the encrypted [DoH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_HTTPS) and [DoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_TLS) protocols. We use the unified hosts from [StevenBlack](https://github.com/StevenBlack) to filter unwanted domains.

## How to use the Usable Privacy DNS Services

## Privacy Policy

1. We do not log client IPs, requested domains or any other personally-identifiable information.
2. We aggregate information on filtered domains and geolocation for user protection.
